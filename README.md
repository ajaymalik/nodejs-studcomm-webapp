# nodejs-studcomm-webapp

A simple web app for student communication management written in NodeJS. This is to enable and empower educational institutions, such as Saskatchewan Polytechnic, to efficiently and timely interact and network with their clients (students). It's a web-portal to enable students to raise concerns, questions or queries to the institute and empower the institute to respond with appropriate clarifications.

It's a “Ticketing solution – a web application portal” using latest and state of the art technologies running on Cloud computing platform.

I worked on it as part of my academic project. In this product, I developed a web-application portal which the clients (current, past, and prospective students) can easily access across the globe, via browsers such as Chrome and Safari. Students studying or aiming to study at Saskatchewan Polytechnic can utilize this system to raise a ticket to the institute so that the respective staff can respond back with clarifications, in an organized fashion. The system would also ensure communications are not lost over time.
 
Below are some salient features:
• Automatically assign tickets to appropriate staff member or department.
• The concerned staff member(s) would be able to prioritize and respond back to the tickets raised by students.
• The audit history of all tickets raised by students and responses from staff will be recorded and visible for auditing or SLA tracking.
